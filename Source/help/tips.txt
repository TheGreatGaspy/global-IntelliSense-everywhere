if your using everything for searching
http://www.voidtools.com/support/everything/searching/
then i recommand using this
for searching a wordlist. this is sometimes useful. for example: you want include oter worddlists an need to find a matching one:
path:\Wordlists\ endwith:.txt YourSearchedFileName
